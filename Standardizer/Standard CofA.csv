Revenue,"Discounts, Returns and Refunds","Discounts, Returns and Refunds",4901,Fee Discounts,,"This revenue center includes client and employee discounts and fee accommodations are posted to this account. In the veterinary profession, the level of fee discounting can be relatively significant. For this reason, discounts are recorded as a debit directly offsetting operational revenues, so that management has an improved awareness of discounting impact on overall cost of operations. When offset against gross revenues charged, discounts reduce the total operating revenue figure that is used to calculate each expense as a percent of it. One challenge is that all fee discounts are not recorded in practice records. Many times, veterinarians provide free services (either intentionally or accidentally) that are never shown on the practice’s records, thus understating the true level of client discounts. This oversight creates yet another problem: no recorded history of what was done for the patient exists."
